# The Martian Chronicles 🚀

As a NASA scientist, you are constantly exploring the fascinating world of Mars 🚀. You have just received a batch of images captured by the Mars Rover and you are eager to analyze them 🔍. However, manually going through all of images is a time-consuming and tedious task 😴.

You have a brilliant idea to create a Python GUI app that can fetch and display the latest images from the Mars Rover based on specific parameters 💡. You remember learning about PyQT, a powerful library for creating GUI apps, and you decide to use it for this project 💻.

You quickly started coding and soon enough, your app is able to retrieve the latest images from the Mars Rover API 💥. You added a "Generate Image" button that generates and displays the images based on the parameters entered by the user 🖼️. It's a great start, but you want to take it one step further 💪.

You want to share the images with your colleagues and friends, but you don't want to go through the hassle of manually sending each image 📩. You remember learning about different Python libraries and APIs for sending emails and you decide to integrate this functionality into your app 💻.

With the help of the library or API, you add the ability to send an email with the generated image as an attachment 📎. The user can enter the subject and message body of the email, as well as a list of recipients 📫.

Upon successful completion of sending the email, you added a toast message that appears on the screen, informing the user that the email was sent successfully 🎉. Your app is now able to generate and display the latest images from Mars and also send an email with the image attachment in just a few clicks 🤩. Implement the above told story and feel proud of your accomplishment and excitedly share your app with the world 🌎.
